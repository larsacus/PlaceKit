/** These category methods differ from their pure block-based counterparts in that they are using AFNetworking's UIImageView+AFNetworking category under the hood. This gives these category methods some small tidbits like image caching.
 
 Use the explicit size category methods when doing things in unlaid-out objects like before a collection view cell has been laid out. You may know the size of the image from the layout information, but the UIImageView that you will be using doesn't yet have a size.
 
 If you only need an image or don't want things the AFNetworking category provides, use the block-based image fetching methods in PlaceKit Core.
